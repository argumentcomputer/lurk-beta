\section{Introduction}

Lurk is a functional programming language based on Lisp. An important concept in its design is Continuation Passing Style (CPS)~\footnote{A good source of information on CPS is the book ``Essentials of Programming Languages''~\cite{FWbook}}, where the control flow of programs can be managed through the usage of \textit{continuations}, which represents the rest of the computation. This technique allows to divide the program into small parts. Hence we have that we can build a small circuit for each part. We will summarize the main concepts involved in the design of the language, such that reader can understand how zero-knowledge proofs~\cite{groth16, nova, halo2} are constructed to provide privacy to Lurk's programs.

\section{Lurk}

In this section we provide a summary of Lurk main elements. Shortly, an \textit{expression} represents a computation involving literals, variables, operations and procedures. Variables are handled by an \textit{environment}, which is responsible for binding variables and values. Also, we use \textit{continuations} to indicate what must done to finish the computation.

We have that the system's IO is formed by an expression, an environment and a continuation. These 3 elements are essential to comprehend Lurk. Each element is represented as a pointers, which is implemented using hash functions. In particular, we use Poseidon~\cite{poseidon} to instantiate our pointers.

The environment has a list of bindings, which correspond to a mapping between variables and values in a certain point in time. Therefore it has local bindings, meaning that the mapping is valid only for a specific evaluation of an expression. On the other hand, the global state is represented by the \textit{store}, which behaves as a memory of the system. We have that the store is global, while the environment is local.

\subsection{Overview}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] \textbf{t, nil:} are self-evaluating and represent true and false, respectively.
  \item[-] \textbf{if:} it has the format \verb|(if <test> <consequent> <alternate>)| and represents a conditional expression. It \textbf{must} receive all 3 parameters, where the \verb|<test>| is an expression used to select the result; the \verb|<consequent>| is selected if the \verb|<test>| evaluates to non-\verb|nil|; and \verb|<alternate>| is selected otherwise. We remark that differently from other programming languages, the \verb|<alternate>| expression is mandatory.
  \item[-] \textbf{lambda:} it has the format \verb|(lambda <formals> <body>)| and represents a procedure. The environment when the lambda expression is evaluated is used as a \textbf{closure}, which is extended with \verb|<formals>|, a list of variables. The unique expression in the \verb|<body>| is evaluated and returned as result of the lambda expression.
  \item[-] \textbf{let:} it has the format \verb|(let <bindings> <body>)| and represents an assignment expression, where \verb|<bindings>| represents a list of pairs in the form \verb|(<variable>, <init>)|; and \verb|<body>| is a unique expression.
  \item[-] \textbf{letrec:} it has the same format as \verb|<let>| expressions, following the same rules, but also allowing recursion.
  \item[-] \textbf{quote:} it has the format \verb|(quote <datum>)| or \verb|(' <datum>)| and evaluates to \verb|<datum>|.
  \item[-] \textbf{atom:} it has the format \verb|(atom <e>)|, and it evaluates to \verb|t| if \verb|<e>| is not a list, and evaluates to \verb|nil| otherwise.
  \item[-] \textbf{cons, car, cdr:} The expression \verb|(cons <a> <d>)| produces a pair whose \verb|car| is \verb|<a>| and \verb|cdr| if \verb|<d>|.
  \item[-] \textbf{arithmetic operations:} it has the format \verb|(<op> <e1> <e2>)|, where \verb|<op>| corresponds to an arithmetic operation ($+, -, \star, \slash$). We have that \verb|<e1>| is evaluated before \verb|<e2>| and the operation is carried out in the finite field that is used in the subjacent zero-knowledge backend.
  \item[-] \textbf{equality:} it has the format \verb|(<op> <e1> <e2>)|, where \verb|<op>| can be either \verb|=| or \verb|eq|. The equality symbol \verb|=| is used to compare expressions whose result is a number (finite field elements), while the symbol \verb|eq| is used to compare pointers.
  \item[-] \textbf{emit:} it has the format \verb|(emit <e>)| and is used to return the result of the evaluation of \verb|<e>| as a public value, which can be used to define the instance of the zero-knowledge statement.
  \item[-] \textbf{begin:} is has the format \verb|(begin <e> ...)|. The sequence of expressions is evaluated from left to right and the last result is returned.
  \item[-] \textbf{current env:} it returns the current environment represented as an association list.
  \item[-] \textbf{eval:} it has format \verb|(eval <exp>)| or \verb|(eval <exp> <env>)|. The evaluation of \verb|<exp>| is used as an expression in the environment obtained from the evaluation of \verb|<env>|. If no \verb|<env>| is provided, an empty environment is used.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Fibonacci example}

See next the code snippet that implements the Fibonacci's sequence:

\begin{verbatim}
>
(letrec ((next (lambda (a b n target)
        (if (eq n target)
            a
                (next b
                (+ a b)
                (+ 1 n)
                    target))))
            (fib (next 0 1 0)))
        (fib 10))
[521 iterations] => 55
\end{verbatim}

\section{Circuit}

Here we describe the construction of Lurk's circuit.

\subsection{Overview}

A Lurk program is split into a sequence of \textit{reduction steps}, also called iterations. In the Fibonacci example above we have 521 iterations, and each one is mapped into a \textit{frame}. We group a set of frames into a MultiFrame object.

We construct a CircuitFrame for each frame, and a Circuit is a sequence of CircuitFrames, where the output of a previous one is linked to the input of the next. The circuit mimics the evaluation of Lurk expressions.

In \verb|eval.rs| it is possible to see the implementation of evaluation of Lurk's expressions. An important function is called $\redwithwit()$, which is responsible for the computation of reduction steps with its witnesses. Since a reduction step is exactly what we want prove in zero-knowledge, we provide an implementation that carries out the same computation, but in the circuit. This implementation is accomplished by $\redexp()$. Therefore we are going to describe how this implementation works.

We call \textit{global symbols} the set of Lurk symbols that are pre-computed, such that we can easily compare with symbols found during the evaluation of expressions.

To reduce an expression, we require a substancial amount of conditions that depend upon comparisons among symbols. Those conditions involve mostly allocation of variables and pointers in the circuit, Boolean logic using those elements, and conditionals. This functionality is implemented in method $\redsym()$. The Boolean logic and equality tests are executed against global symbols and other auxiliary variables created along the process in order to decide how we are going to take decisions about control flow of Lurk programs. Using it we also can update the environment and the store accordingly.

One of the most important building blocks in a functional language like Lisp and Lurk is \verb|cons|. It is used to concatenate \verb|car| and \verb|cdr|. Hence, whenever we want to break big expressions into smallers ones, we can use a combination of those elements. In function $\redcons()$ we deal with each different situation where those elements are necessary. Namely, to reduce an expression into smaller pieces, we allocate in the circuit some auxiliary variables for later utilization. In particular, $\carcdr()$ gadget is used as a building block. Since this computation is required for different situations, depending on the type fo expression we are handling, for each one we include a clause in a multicase gadget. Thus we can easily select the desired result using this approach. The multicase selection is based on the \verb|head| of an expression, which we get using \verb|car|. Finally, we return the result of the multicase.

% It can be optimized in the same way as apply continuation

%$\makethunk()$

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Another important function is $\applycont()$. In order to finish a reduction step, we must calculate the output the frame, and that is what we are going to explain now. Each iteration has a continuation tag, and for each one we need to compute the next expression, environment, continuation and thunk. Therefore we have to constrain the system to prove we are computing the correct elements, and we have to allocate pointers to use them later. This task is executed in 2 stages:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[-] Some continuations require the calculation of new pointers, while others don't. For those which indeed need new pointers, since the implementation of pointers requires a hash computation, and because hashes are expensive in the circuit, we use a multicase to select the appropriate hash preimage. Then we can compute the hashes just once. This allows us to avoid computation of unnecessary hashes.
	\item[-] Selection of the continuation results using another multicase.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Gadgets}

In order to construct the circuit we use the following building blocks:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[-] Macros:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Boolean.
	    \item Equality.
		\item Conditionals.
		\item Pick.
	\end{itemize}
	\item[-] Constraints:
	\begin{itemize}
        \item Arithmetic operations.
		\item Utils.
	\end{itemize}
	\item[-] Pointers: tag and hash.
    \item[-] Data: allocate and reverse lookup.
    \item[-] Multicase.
\end{itemize}
